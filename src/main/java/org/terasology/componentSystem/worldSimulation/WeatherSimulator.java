	 *  will be your friends in snowy areas.*/
	//TODO this class could also rarely cause massive damages like meteorites, earthquakes, landslides,
	//forestfires, land disortions/destructions and other not so player friendly events. And especially some really odd, unexpected, rare and cool events. 
	//herd of gelatinous cubes suddenly spawning in middle of cubeland wrecking chaos. ]:-)
	//maybe we need natural disaster class for that. that kind of events will make game more unpredictable(which is interesting)
	//cow hers spawning in middle of city would be cool too
	//TODO Remove this class if code should be some where else
