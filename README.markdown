Blockmania is a small open source project of mine to research procedural terrain generation and efficient rendering techniques in Java using the LWJGL. The engine uses a block-based voxel-like approach as seen in Minecraft.

The current version is nothing more and nothing less than a tech demo. If everything is working as it should, I'll might start thinking about content to create an actual game. Who knows. ;)

For more information on the project visit my blog: [Moving Blocks!](http://blog.movingblocks.net).

Additional Notes
